## Description
This is a C# console application that will prompt a user for multiple inputs with specified instructions.
There are multiple question types beginning with "enter a number greater than zero", from there, a user will have multiple prompts to enter numerical values based upon their input. (WARNING-Errors will be thrown if you stray outside of the values)
At the end of the game the user receives their total array size, the numbers within the array, the Sum of the array, along with the product of the sum and the quotient totals.
